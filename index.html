  <h2>My name is Mira M. Aslanova. I am a Computer Science Major at the Univeristy of Rhode Island. On the home button, you can find the Main 
    Page and navigate throughout my website. On the JavaScript page, it includes code that has been embeded into the website. The Apps page will 
    include applications that you may run on your mobile device. Lastly, I have included a few details about myself on the last tab.
