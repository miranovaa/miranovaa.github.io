  <h1>About Mira!</h1> 
    
  <p>My name is Mira M. Aslanova. I am a Computer Science Major at the <br>
    Univeristy of Rhode Island. I am fairly new to the state of Rhode Island <br> 
    as I got stationed here a little over a year ago. I was originally born in Russia, <br> 
    but came to the United States as a refugee when I was about 6 years old. My lovley <br> 
    adoptive family lives in California and Ohio. 
   </p>
   <p> I absolutely love working on cars. Hiking and working out are also two more of <br> 
     my hobbies. I enjoy powerlifting tremendiously, but with the gyms being closed it has <br> 
     truly stopped me from being able to do anything close to it. 
    </p>
